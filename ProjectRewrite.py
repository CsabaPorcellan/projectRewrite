min(x, y) 
    For any two real numbers the less is returned
    No built-in functions are used

max(values_list)

    For any list of real numbers the greatest is returned
    No built-in functions are used

Implement the len(values_list) function for a list of numbers or strings which returns the length of the list!

    For any list the count of the elements is returned
    No built-in functions are used

Implement the multiply(x, y) function for integer numbers as inputs! Do not use the *, /, and // operators and any built-in functions, but you may (and should) use +.

    For any two integer inputs the returned value equals the result of x * y
    Neither *, /, // nor any built-in functions are used
mplement the pow(x, y) function for real base numbers and positive integer exponents! Do not use the ** operator and any built-in functions! Here you can use *.

    For inputs from the specified domain the returned value equals the result of x**y
    Neither ** nor any built-in functions are used

divmod()
OPTIONAL Implement the divmod(x, y) function for for two integer numbers as inputs! Do not use the // and the % operators and any built-in functions! It should return a tuple: the first value should be equal to the value of x // y and the second equal to the value of x % y! Do not use the // operator and any built-in functions!

    For any two positive integer inputs the returned value equals (x // y, x % y)
    For any two +/- integer inputs the returned value equals (x // y, x % y)
    Neither // nor any built-in functions are used
